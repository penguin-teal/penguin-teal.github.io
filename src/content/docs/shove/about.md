title: shove
description: A language and compiler.
---

shove is a programming language and compiler.

It uses LLVM and writes zero-overhead code.

The compiler is no longer being developed or maintained, and I am now focusing
on [ANSLL](https://github.com/penguin-teal/ansll), another language and compiler.
shove never got too far but it most importantly taught me about the LLVM API
and lexers.

More information is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/penguin-teal/shove)
and in the README.
