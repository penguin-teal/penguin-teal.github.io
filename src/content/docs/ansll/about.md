title: ANSLL
description: A math-oriented language.
---

ANSLL is a math-oriented zero-overhead language that is meant to work similarly
and alongside C.

ANSLL will eventually have its own standard, separate from the compiler.
This is the way C and C++ do it, and ensures that the language is not tied
to whatever my specific compiler does.

The ANSLL compiler is not usable yet. It is my next compiler after
[shove](https://github.com/penguin-teal/shove).

More information is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/penguin-teal/ansll)
and in the README.
